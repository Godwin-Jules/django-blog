# Django-Blog
A simple blog application built with Django, the most popular web framework for the most popular programming language: Python.

## Quick Overview
The application allow user to create, read, update, delete posts. Il also allow user to add a specific post to a "Read Later" list. It's just a simple dummy django application that I made with Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller which is the final project of his Practical Guide on Django Course on Udemy. So some modern blog website features are not implemented yet but I hope to implement them in the future.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Django
- SQLite

This application is deployed on Render. You can check it out [here](https://django-blog-nr4l.onrender.com/)
